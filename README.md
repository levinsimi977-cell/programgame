## 🕹️ About the Games



### 🃏 Dobble (Spot It)

A fast-paced pattern recognition challenge where speed and accuracy are key.

* **The Goal**: Identify the single matching symbol between two randomly generated cards before time runs out.

* **Technical Highlight**: Implements a sophisticated mathematical algorithm to ensure that every pair of cards in the deck shares exactly one (and only one) common symbol.



### 🔴 Bulls and Cows (Bull Pgia)

A classic code-breaking mind game that tests deductive reasoning.

* **The Goal**: Guess a hidden 4-digit number generated by the system.

* **Technical Highlight**: Features complex validation logic that provides real-time feedback:

    * **Bulls**: Correct digit in the correct position.

    * **Cows**: Correct digit in the wrong position.



### 🧠 Memory Match

A classic concentration game designed to test visual memory.

* **The Goal**: Flip over cards and find all matching pairs in the shortest time possible.

* **Technical Highlight**: Manages asynchronous game states, including card-flipping animations, match-detection delays, and automatic board shuffling.



### 💡 Simon Says (Light Game)

An addictive memory-sequence game that challenges your focus.

* **The Goal**: Watch the sequence of lights and sounds, then repeat it perfectly as the sequence grows longer.

* **Technical Highlight**: Utilizes array-based sequence tracking and recursive timing to manage increasing difficulty levels and verify user input accuracy.
